# color_images
I created color images by changing the RGB numbers.Opencv uses BGR image format so I reversed numbers.
Color images are red, green, blue, yellow, purple, white and black, directory is created to define classes for images, so there are 7 classes of images. 
I then created the model and achieved 99% accuracy for validatin data
In the second stage I added some noises to color images and repeated the previous work and achieved 84% accuracy for validation data(in this data, variance was 70).
